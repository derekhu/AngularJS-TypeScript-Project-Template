AngularJS and TypeScript super simple project template
------------------------------------------------------

This is a very simple project template for creating AngularJS applications with TypeScript.

`app.ts` contains all the logic that allows to create controllers, filter, directives and services in a *TypeScript*-y way. A sample controller, filter, directive and service are included and being used in a sample view.

This project is based in [/JakubMrozek/generator-angular-typescript](https://github.com/JakubMrozek/generator-angular-typescript) and uses [/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped) for the AngularJS type definitions.
